VRML parser version 0.1


Hello VRML lovers / haters

This is a simple VRML parser written in C++ but using C style code. 
I just wanted to take advandage of the C++ API and make it easy to 
port it later to C. So no class, no polymorphism and no C++ related tricks.
There are many C++ parsers out there that are working much better but
this is a simple solution without any dependencies.

+ Easy to add new keywords (nodes or fields)

- It is not 100% ready it need a lot o work but it is just
  copy paste and rename it to support the full standard.

- The code is a little bit messy but i am working on it.
